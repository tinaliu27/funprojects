## Pong Game 

### First fun project made by Tina Liu! 

Tools: ![Processing photo](./images/processinglogo.svg = 100x20)
In efforts to strengthen my skills in Processing I revised a pong game that I created for my computer creativity course at UBC (COSC123). Initially my game looked like this:

The game's functionalities were very limited. First off, the ball didn't bounce correctly from the paddle. I wanted to revise this issue in the newest game. Secondly, I wanted to change the game into a 2 person game to increase the difficulty. Thirdly, I wanted to include a reset button so I wouldn't need to rerun the code if I wanted to restart. Lastly, I changed the paddle to move from the mouse to the following keyboard keys: 'UP arrow', 'DOWN arrow', 'A', and 'Z'.

All in all, my intial pong game is relatively boring and plain. Therefore, I wanted to add some improvements to yield the following results:

I changed the entire layout of the game and focused on making it more interactive between two different players. Now you able to play a classic pong game. Hope you enjoy and have fun!
